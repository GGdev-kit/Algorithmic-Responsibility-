# README.md

The **Algorithmic Responsibility Record (ARR)** is a pre-incident governance artefact for algorithmic decision systems.

It exists to formally record **who accepted responsibility for an algorithmic decision, under what constraints, and with what residual risk — before deployment**.

When something goes wrong, institutions are judged on what they recorded in advance, not on what they can explain afterward.

## Why ARR exists

Most AI governance mechanisms focus on:
- model performance
- post-hoc explanation
- ethical principles
- compliance checklists

These approaches routinely fail under regulatory, legal, or investigative scrutiny because they do not answer the first questions asked after an incident:

- Who authorised the system’s use?
- What was it explicitly allowed to do?
- Who could override it?
- What risks were knowingly accepted?
- Where was responsibility formally recorded?

In many organisations, the answer is simple: **it wasn’t**.

ARR makes that absence visible.

## What an ARR records

An Algorithmic Responsibility Record documents:

- Decision identity
- System provenance (model, version, dependencies)
- Decision boundaries (permitted and prohibited actions)
- Human oversight and escalation paths
- Explicit risk acceptance, including residual risk
- Override authority and conditions
- Formal attestation of accountability

ARR is intentionally narrow. Its power comes from restraint.

## What ARR is not

ARR is **not**:
- a model card
- a performance report
- an ethics framework
- a compliance checklist
- a post-incident explanation

ARR does not explain decisions after the fact.  
It records responsibility before deployment.

## Status

**ARR Practitioner Standard v0.1** is published as a public working draft.

Early paid pilot engagements are underway with organisations operating under regulatory pressure.
